      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Mike grew up in the great state of Minnesota, where playing hockey and being cold are the treasured pasttimes. He attended college at Northwestern University, and majored in Economics as he wanted to gain a deeper understanding of what was happening in the markets at the time (in reality it just seemed like an easy major). After graduating, he spent 7 months as a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, before switching into FinTech consulting for Sapient. He came back to Kellogg to build his analytical toolkit in a challenging and collaborative environment, with the goal of working for a big tech firm as a product manager. Oh yeah, and he plays a MEAN guitar, having melted several faces over the years.
